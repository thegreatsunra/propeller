# propeller 0.5.6

Static site generator in [Assemble](http://assemble.io) and [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com) using [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com) templates, with additional support for [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org), [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com), [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com), [D3](http://d3js.org) and CSV parsing.

## Getting started

1. Download and install [Node](http://nodejs.org)
1. At the command line install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io), [Bower](http://bower.io) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) globally by typing `sudo npm install -g yo bower grunt-cli`
1. Clone, download and unzip, or use [generator-propeller](http://github.com/thegreatsunra/generator-propeller) to create a new Propeller project

### Now you're ready to use Propeller

1. Open your new Propeller project at the command line
1. Type `npm install && bower install` to make sure all dependencies are installed
1. Type `grunt` at the command line to run the tasks to generate your static site, which will appear in a `/dist` folder in your project
1. Type `grunt serve` to start your development server. Propeller will monitor the files in the `/src` folder and update your static site whenever it detects changes
1. Open [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) in a web browser to view your site
1. Begin creating your site by modifying the files in the `/src` folder

## Additional Information

* Propeller uses [Assemble](http://assemble.io) and [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com) as its templating engine
* When the server is running it monitors for file updates, and automatically regenerates the static files
* The server also monitors for changes to [LESS](http://lesscss.org) files, and automatically compiles them into static CSS files when updated
