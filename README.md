## Additional Information

* Propeller uses [Assemble](http://assemble.io) and [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com) as its templating engine
* When the server is running it monitors for file updates, and automatically regenerates the static files
* The server also monitors for changes to [LESS](http://lesscss.org) files, and automatically compiles them into static CSS files when updated
