/* 
  Propeller will process any LESS files in this folder,
  generating CSS files from them in expanded (.css)
  and minified (.min.css) flavors.

  LESS files preceeded with an underscore (i.e. _base.less)
  will be ignored. Propeller assumes these files
  are partials that are being imported into a
  manifest file (i.e. styles.css).

  LESS files in nested folders will be handled as well.
